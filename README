Programming language: Python with libraries pandas, numpy, itertools, math, copy, and json

Instructions to run: python3 hclustering.py <filepath to input csv> <optional: threshold number (max circumference of clusters)>

hclustering.py: A program read and parse input files of datasets to use hierarchical clustering and output a dendrogram showing the hierarchical cluster tree in an output file "outputDendrogram.json". If a threshold for maximum circumference is given as a parameter, we also output the clusters from cutting the dendrogram at the threshold in "clusters.txt". Clusters are made by single link distance, and distance is computed with the euclidian formula. An optional last parameter after the threshold is a "c" for complete linkage instead of single link distance.
